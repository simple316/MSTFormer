# MSTFormer: Motion Inspired Spatial-temporal Transformer with Dynamic-aware Attention for long-term Vessel Trajectory Prediction
This is a method for long-term ship trajectory prediction. It mainly improves the trajectory prediction performance by data augmentation, dynamic-aware attention, and knowledge-inspired loss function.


## Requirements
```
geopy==2.2.0
ipdb==0.13.9
matplotlib==3.5.1
numpy==1.22.4
numpy_ext==0.9.8
pandas==1.4.3
scipy==1.8.1
torch==1.11.0
```

## Data
A simple dataset is provided for testing the code, or you can generate your own by rewriting data_loader.py.This project provides some commented out code that we use to process the data for reference.
## Run
After configuring the environment, just run main_MSTFomer.py directly. Also, you can test different data by changing the parameters inside. The file where the logs are saved can be changed by changing the path in log.py.
